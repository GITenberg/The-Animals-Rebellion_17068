    <h3>The Animals' Rebellion.</h3>
    <p>The "Trip to Sea"<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> had long been made,<br />
    The "Picnic"<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> bills had all been paid;<br />
    But if you'll listen, I will tell<br />
    What made the animals rebel.</p>
    <p>The Tiger was dissatisfied&mdash;<br />
    "Why should the Lion reign?" he cried;<br />
    "He's no more King of Beasts than I;<br />
    So let us all his rule defy!"</p>

    <p>A secret meeting then he called:<br />
    And while the others stood appalled,<br />
    His wants and grievances explained,<br />
    And quickly some adherents gained.</p>
    <p>The Fox his joy could not conceal--<br />
    "In guns," thought he, "I'll make a deal!"<br />
    The Owl, who all his speeches heard,<br />
    Took care to take down every word:</p>
    <p>And ere the rising of the sun,<br />
    The Great Rebellion had begun!</p>

    <h3>The Tiger's Petition</h3>
    <p>The King sat on his Throne one day,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;His Crown upon his brow;<br />
    To him, in most obsequious way,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The Tiger made his bow.</p>
    <p>His long petition he unrolled,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;With names all written down;<br />
    The courtiers stared&mdash;their blood ran cold&mdash;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;King Leo gave a frown.</p>
    <p>"What have we here?" demanded he,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"And what does he require?"<br />
    The Elephant said, "Here I see<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A traitor, royal sire!"</p>
    <p>The Brown Bear murmured, "So do I&mdash;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;He's right, without a doubt!"<br />
    The monarch cried, with flashing eye,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"Turn this intruder out!"<br />

    <p>At midnight, in an empty hut,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in the forest old,<br />
    The Rebels met with doors close shut,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Their dark schemes to unfold.</p>
    <p>"Friends!" Tiger cried, "no more we'll brook<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;This despot's cruel reign;<br />
    Our charter lies before us&mdash;look!<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The plan of our campaign!"</p>

    <h3>Mr. Fox's Armoury.</h3>
    <p>Directly Brother Fox was told,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;He ransacked all his stores,<br />
    And soon was making bags of gold<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;And selling guns in scores.</p>
    <p>The Brown Bear bought a blunderbuss;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;And when they saw the arm,<br />
    The Bunnies all cried, "Don't shoot <i>us</i>!<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;We've not done any harm!"</p>
    <p>The Tiger thought revolvers best,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;So he bought half a score;<br />
    "No guns I've had," said Fox, with zest,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>Went off</i> so well before!"</p>
    <p>"Don't fear, my Bunnies, you'll be shot,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Though each has bought a gun;<br />
    I'll whisper this," said Fox: "they've got<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Blank cartridge ev'ry one!"<br />

    <br />
    <h3>Raising the Standard.</h3>
    <p>From lair to lair the news soon spread,<br />
    And one and all leapt out of bed,<br />
    And sallied forth, with loud hurrays,<br />
    The Standard of Revolt to raise.</p>
    <p>The Bear looked fierce, the Crocodile<br />
    Put on his most bloodthirsty smile;<br />
    The Leopard and the Wolf were there,<br />
    And cheers resounded in the air.</p>
    <img border="0" src="images/13b.png" width="192" height="200"
    style="float: right; margin-right: 15%" alt="" />
    <p>The Tiger roared a lengthy speech,<br />
    And called, in loudest tones, on each<br />
    To do his best when came the fray,<br />
    Not be afraid, nor run away.</p>
    <p>Cried he: "Now, onward to the field,<br />
    To make this tyrant monarch yield!"<br />
    "Charge, Leopard, charge&mdash;on, Tiger, on!"<br />
    Were the first words of Rebellion.</p>

    <p>Next morn a Scout the Camp alarms,<br />
    The Lion's soldiers fly to arms.<br />
    "The enemy advance!" he cries,<br />
    "And means to take you by surprise!"<br />
    In Leo's Camp, on Zootown plains,<br />
    The utmost consternation reigns.</p>

    <h3>In Leo's Camp.</h3>
    <p>This startling news the peaceful Camp<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;With preparation fills,<br />
    Resounding with the soldiers' tramp,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The noise of many drills.</p>
    <img border="0" src="images/16b.png" width="139" height="272"
    style="float: left; margin-left: 2%" alt="" />
    <p>The Sergeants shout, the General storms;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;All round one sees and hears<br />
    The trying on of uniforms,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The clank of swords and spears.</p>
    <p>The Fox pretended, by and by,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;To be deaf, dumb and lame;<br />
    But Jacko, with a placard "Spy,"<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Quite spoilt his little game.</p>
    <p>Field Marshal Hippo shouted out,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"Arrest him on the spot!"<br />
    If he had not escaped, no doubt<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;He'd promptly have been shot.</p>

    <h3><br />
    Preparing for the Fray.</h3>
    <p>Preparing for the coming fray,<br />
    The Camp was busy night and day;<br />
    The Rhino had his horn re-ground,<br />
    Because it had got blunt he found.</p>
    <p>The Elephant had his tusks, too,<br />
    Re-sharpened till they looked like new;<br />
    In fact, the Ape's new grindstone strong<br />
    Was working nearly all day long.</p>
    <img border="0" src="images/18b.png" width="147" height="192"
    style="float: left; margin-left: 2%" alt="" />
    <p>All day the Camp was never still&mdash;<br />
    With marching to and fro, and drill;<br />
    And quite right too, since it appears<br />
    They hadn't been to war for years.</p>
    <p>The oldest there had never known<br />
    Such preparations to be shown;<br />
    Indeed, they'd never had, somehow,<br />
    A great Rebellion until now.</p>

    <p>Next day took place the Grand Review,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Before His Majesty,<br />
    The troops marched past in order true--<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A splendid sight to see.</p>
    <p>The speech he made filled all with pride,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;As brave as brave could be:<br />
    "For Country and for King," he cried,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"On, on to victory!"</p>

    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>The Advance Guard.</h3>
    <p>Then marched they forth unto the fray<br />
    A battle fierce took place next day;<br />
    I'm told it was a fearful fight,<br />
    That lasted quite from morn till night.</p>
    <p>Through hail of shot and rain of lead,<br />
    His Rebel band the Tiger led;<br />
    And found that when the fight was done<br />
    A brilliant victory was won.</p>
    <p>In vain King Leo's gallant band<br />
    (The Prince of Tails was in command)<br />
    Essayed the Rebel force to beat&mdash;<br />
    The effort ended in defeat.</p>
    <p>Their cocoa-nuts, with deadly aim,<br />
    The Monkeys threw, but all the same;<br />
    Though Jumbo streams of water poured,<br />
    The enemy a victory scored.</p>

    <h3>The Elephant Wounded.</h3>
    <p>Alas! for he so bravely fought,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Jumbo wounded lay;<br />
    The ambulance they quickly brought<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;To where he fell that day.</p>
    <p>"To Hospital this instant!" cried<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The Surgeon in command;<br />
    "Don't let them say he would have died<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;If we'd not been at hand!"</p>
    <p>"But, wait," he said, "till I with care<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Have quite examined him!"<br />
    He probed him here, and probed him there,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;And tested every limb.</p>
    <p>"It's but a nervous shock!" he said,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"Since he's so large and fat;<br />
    You can't take him, and so, instead,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;You'd better take his hat!"</p>

    <p>Ere dusk the King's troops had retreated,<br />
    By Tiger's Rebel band defeated;<br />
    They ran pell-mell and helter-skelter,<br />
    For any place to give them shelter.</p>
    <p>The Elephant, though he was wounded,<br />
    Ran faster than the big Baboon did;<br />
    The Owl to Camp flew like a bird<br />
    To tell the King what had occurred.</p>

    <p>Rejoicings in the Rebel Camp<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Were great indeed that night;<br />
    Each tent hung out a Chinese lamp<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;To celebrate the fight.</p>
    <p>They sang and shouted, o'er and o'er,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Until their throats were tired;<br />
    They let off fireworks by the score,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A "feu de joie" was fired.</p>
    <p>When Wolf, who's not a marksman good,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Shot holes in Bear's new hat,<br />
    Bear never even said, "You should<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Apologise for that!"</p>
    <p>In short, they would, as like as not,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Have kept it up till day;<br />
    Had someone not found out they'd shot<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Their powder all away.</p>

    <h3>Marching on the King's Capital.</h3>
    <p>Next morn, with victory elate,<br />
    "Why should we wait or hesitate?<br />
    We'll march at once, without delay,<br />
    Upon the Capital!" cried they.</p>
    <p>"That's <i>capital</i>!" a Monkey said,<br />
    (But he at once was sent to bed!)<br />
    But, all the same, it was agreed,<br />
    So General Tiger took the lead.</p>
    <p>With flying flags and drums rat-tan<br />
    The Rebels' onward march began.<br />
    Cried Tiger, "Leoville one mile!"<br />
    "That's nothing!" said the Crocodile.</p>
    <p>But Wolf, who kept a good look-out,<br />
    Saw Private Whiskers out on scout.<br />
    "Ha, ha," cried he, "I've caught a spy&mdash;<br />
    That means promotion by and by!"</p>

    <h3>The Battle.</h3>
    <p>Soon with the Lion's gallant troops<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The Rebels were engaged;<br />
    This way and that, 'midst wildest whoops<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The tide of battle raged.</p>
    <p>The Elephant first sounded "Charge!"<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;And valiant deeds performed;<br />
    The Rebels saw his trunk so large,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;And trembled when he stormed.</p>
    <p>At first, though, neither side gained much;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;But when 'twas paw to paw,<br />
    The Owl, in his report, said, "Such<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A fight I never saw!"</p>
    <p>Said Wolf, "No more at war I'll scoff,<br />

    And when the foe's last gun <i>went off</i><br />

    <p>But, oh! the finest sight to see<br />
    Was Leo's Giraffe Cavalry;<br />
    As down the battle plain they tore,<br />
    The Rebels saw that all was o'er.</p>
    <p>As on the Monkey troopers swept,<br />
    The Bunnies to their holes all crept;<br />
    The foe who set triumphant out<br />
    Was first a rabble, then a rout!</p>
    <p>The Owl, in "Zooland," said, next day:<br />
    "Our troops like chaff swept them away;<br />
    Their praises let us loudly sing,<br />
    Who won the day for Leo, King!"</p>

    <p>Field Marshal Leo then and there<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A stern Court-Martial held;<br />
    The prisoner, with defiant air,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Explained why he rebelled.</p>
    <p>"Such conduct," said the President,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"Admits of no defence;<br />
    But since you ask it, I'll consent<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;To hear the evidence."</p>
    <p>'Twas heard&mdash;in "Zooland" of that week<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;You'll find the Owl's report;<br />
    The President then rose to speak,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The sentence of the Court.</p>
    <p>"On all counts guilty he appears&mdash;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoner's sentenced to<br />
    A lenient term&mdash;a hundred years<br />

    <p>The other Rebels, when they heard<br />
    Of what to Tiger had occurred,<br />
    Surrendered everyone next day,<br />
    And threw down arms without delay.</p>
    <p>The Bear said, "I don't want to keep<br />

    The Leopard and the Crocodile<br />

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
